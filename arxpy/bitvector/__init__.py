"""The BitVector module operates with bit-vectors.

- This module allows to operate with bit-vectors expressions in a numeric
  and symbolic way.
- It implements the whole fixed-size bit-vector logics, which includes
  all the common bit-vector operators.
- It follows the syntax and semantics defined in "Complexity of Fixed-Size
  Bit-Vector Logics", which extends the SMT_LIBv2 format.
- It uses SymPy as a back-end.
- Fully tested with unit tests and property tests.
